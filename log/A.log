Progress so far
1. Learned to use the ssl to connect to another linux machine
2. Learned to setup offline repositories
3. Learned to setup online repositories
4. Make a user (Optional)
5. Learned to push without password(using SSH)

1--->
The general format is sshd clonejaro@192.168.56.103
But first u have to start the sshd services every time u reboot
sudo systemctl enable sshd.service
sudo systemctl start sshd.service

2-->
For offline u dont even need an online account
jst make a folder then go inside and run
git init
to setup the folder
For list of file to exclude from syncing use .gitignore
Other command are
git add .
git add repository
git commit -m 'Saving data'
git commit -a -m 'For upadate of new file'
Next Up
Brancing which has 
git branch MyBranch
git checkout master
git stash


3-->
For the online make sure u have net connection
also the command is quite simple
git clone http://****
and more

4-->
Setting up user means u can record who updated 
what
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

5-->
When I try to push to or pull from Github using my PC,
it requires username and password which can be fixed
by using  (SSH) instead of HTTPS
$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
