Progress so far
1. Learned to use the ssl to connect to another linux machine
2. Learned to setup offline repositories
3. Learned to setup online repositories


1--->
The general format is sshd clonejaro@192.168.56.103
But first u have to start the sshd services every time u reboot
sudo systemctl enable sshd.service
sudo systemctl start sshd.service

2-->
For offline u dont even need an online account
jst make a folder then go inside and run
git init
to setup the folder
For list of file to exclude from syncing use .gitignore
Other command are
git add .
git add repository
git commit -m 'Saving data'
git commit -a -m 'For upadate of new file'
Next Up

git branch MyBranch
git checkout master
